## README

The R script "run_analysis.R" is based on data collected by the Center for Machine Learning and Intelligent Systems at UCI, which contains detailed measurements from accelerators in smartphones carried by 30 volunteers.

The script aims to compile the data on averages and standard deviations in the training and test sets of this study in one tidy dataset, as well as summarize the averages for the variables in a separate file. For this script to be successful, it should:

1) Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.

2) Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

3) Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

4) Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names.

5) From the data set in step 4, create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The repository GettingAndCleaningData contains of three files:

1) "README.md"

2) "Codebook.md" (contains details on the original dataset and a detailed step-by-step descriptions of the data transformations carried out by the "run_analysis" script)

3) "run_analysis.R" (R script that tidies
